# Title:         locknpwn
# Description:   Example prank payload for the Bashbunny Powershell Framework.  Bashbunny
#                can be removed when the LED goes green.  Powershell scripts runs in a 
#                hidden powershell window in unattended mode
#
#                Waits 5 minutes (300 seconds) and then triggers rest of the payload
#                Volume on the computer speaker is turned up (and off if already off)
#                Warns the unsuspecting user that they didn't lock their computer while 
#                they were away from their desk and they should have done, because now
#                they've been hacked.
#                Computer is locked 
#                Randomly every 10-30 seconds the computer reminds them that they have been pwned
#
#                This part of the payload simply injects a powershell script onto the victim and shuts down
#                It shows how simple the framework makes running hidden windows powershell admin payloads
